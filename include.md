This is a demonstration of the effect of Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on
simulated samples of different distributions.

Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the
sampling mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets
larger, no matter what the shape of the population distribution.

This web app allows you to generate random samples from four underlying
distribution: normal, uniform, log-normal and exponential. You can
customize the parameters for these distributions.

After determining the distribution, you can determine the number of
samples you want to generate up to 1,000 and size of each samples up to
500. A histogram of the sample distribution will appear on the main
panel. You can choose to compare the distribution to a normal
distribution to check how close the sample distribution resembles normal
distribution. You can also turn on the position of the mean visually in
the histogram. The mean and standard deviation of the simulated samples
and the expected value of these statistics based on the distribution
parameter is also shown below.

If Central Limit Theorem is correct, the sample distribution should
match closely with the normal distribution when sample size is large
enough.
